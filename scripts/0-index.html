<pre>
  Note: A conversion script from sgf to the Galant format for layered graphsD  is in
     https://github.com/mfms-ncsu/galant
  directory Conversion-Scripts

<strong><a href="channelDegrees.py">channelDegrees.py</a> --</strong><br>

<strong><a href="collectParetoPoints.py">collectParetoPoints.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
Designed to gather multiple Pareto points into a single Pareto list;
 it's a simple filter - stdin to stdout - for now

input is a sequence of lines of the form (Pareto output from min_crossings)
  x1^y1;x2^y2;...
output has one Pareto point per line - format is tab separated

<strong><a href="create-lattice.py">create-lattice.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
 Creates a .dot and .ord file for a layered dag
 representing a lattice on a set of a specified number of elements.
 Nodes are numbered so that the binary representation of each node number is
 a bit vector for the corresponding subset.

@todo make this work for sgf files

    Maintains all information about a proper layered graph:
    - list of node id's (in order they were added)
    - mapping from a node id (a string, usually encoding an integer)
      to information about a node
    - layer and position of each node
    - list of (id's of) neighbors above and below each node
    - list of (id's of) nodes on each layer
    - list of edges (in order they were added)
    - graph name and comments

<strong><a href="mlcm2sgf.py">mlcm2sgf.py</a> --</strong><br>

 Translates from mlcm format, as documented at
 http://www-lehre.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/theoinf/index/research/mlcm
 and described below to sgf format, also described below.

mlcm (multi-level crossing minimization) was used in the experiments
descibed in M. Chimani, P. Hungerlaender, M. Juenger, P. Mutzel. An SDP
Approach to Multi-level Crossing Minimization. ACM Journal of Experimental
Algorithmics, Volume 17(3), Article 3.3, 2012. It goes as follows:

<Number-of-Levels>
<Number-of-Edges-Between-First-and-Second-Level>
<Number-of-Edges-Between-Second-and-Third-Level>
...
<Number-of-Nodes-on-First-Level>
<Number-of-Nodes-on-Second-Level>
...
<Index-of-Node-on-First-Layer> <Index-of-Node-on-Second-Level>
<Index-of-Node-on-First-Layer> <Index-of-Node-on-Second-Level>
...
<Index-of-Node-on-Second-Layer> <Index-of-Node-on-Third-Level>
...

The node indices start at 0 on each level, i.e., each level has a node
numbered 0, a node numbered 1, etc. Numbers determine the order, which is
optimal in the files provided at the web site.

sfg format is as follows:

   c comment line 1
   ...
   c comment line k

   t graph_name

   n id_1 layer_1 position_1
   n id_2 layer_2 position_2
   ...
   n id_n layer_n position_n

   e source_1 target_1
   ...
   e source_m target_m

<strong><a href="ralay.py">ralay.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
ralay.py - offers a mechanism for producing layered graphs with
different variances with respect to number of nodes per layer, number of
dummy nodes, degrees of nodes, shapes, etc.. Output is in sgf format, which
can be converted to dot or graphml, as desired. Graphs are guaranteed to be
connected (and interesting) because each node has indegree 1 (unless on layer 0)
and outdegree 1 (unless on the highest layer).
