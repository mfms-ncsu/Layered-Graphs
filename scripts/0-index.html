<h3>Files in lexicographic order</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="channelDegrees.py">channelDegrees.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
  Takes an sgf file and prints statistics about degrees
  of nodes relative to the upper and lower layers of each channel
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="collectParetoPoints.py">collectParetoPoints.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
Designed to gather multiple Pareto points into a single Pareto list;
 it's a simple filter - stdin to stdout,
 but has options to specify input and output files as well as output format

input is a sequence of lines of the form (Pareto output from minimization)
  x1^y1;x2^y2;...
output format is specified by the -f or --format option
</pre>

<li>
<strong><a href="create-lattice.py">create-lattice.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
 Creates a .dot and .ord file for a layered dag
 representing a lattice on a set of a specified number of elements.
 Nodes are numbered so that the binary representation of each node number is
 a bit vector for the corresponding subset.

@todo make this work for sgf files

<strong><a href="dot+ord2sgf.sh">dot+ord2sgf.sh</a> --</strong><br>

</pre>
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="harvest_sgf_data.sh">harvest_sgf_data.sh</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
outputs lines of the form
   TAG VALUE       (separated by tab)
for tags LG-Nodes, LG-Edges, and LG-Layers,
representing number of nodes, edges, and layers in the sgf input file
</pre>
</li>
<hr><br>
<li>
<strong><a href="layeredGraph.py">layeredGraph.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
    Maintains all information about a proper layered graph:
    - list of node id's (in order they were added)
    - mapping from a node id (a string, usually encoding an integer)
      to information about a node
    - layer and position of each node
    - list of (id's of) neighbors above and below each node
    - list of (id's of) nodes on each layer
    - list of edges (in order they were added)
    - graph name and comments
</pre>
</li>
<hr><br>

<strong><a href="lff2sgf.py">lff2sgf.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
 Translates from (l)ayer (f)irst (f)ormat (for lack of a better name),
 used in recent papers, such as
 Martí, R., Campos, V., Hoff, A., Peiró, J.,
  "Heuristics for the min–max arc crossing problem in graphs."
  in Expert Systems with Applications 109, 100 – 113.
 and files downloaded from
 https://grafo.etsii.urjc.es/optsicom/mmacp/mmacpfiles/MinMaxGDPlib.zip

The lff format begins with a line of the form
  NUMBER_NODES NUMBER_OF_EDGES NUMBER_OF_LAYERS
The second line lists the number of nodes on each layer, starting with the "bottom"
(or "left" based on figures in the Martí et al. paper).
All edges are directed from earlier layers to later ones, not that this matters.

Each subsequent line has two integers, the endpoints of an edge.
Node numbers for these edges are implicit from the number of nodes on the layers.
For example, if the second line in the file is.
 2 3 4
then nodes 1 and 2 are on layer 1, nodes 3-5 on layer 2 and nodes 6-9 on layer 3.

sgf format is described in, among others, mlcm2sgf.py
IMPORTANT: The minimization program in src assumes layers are numbered starting at 0.

Usage: lff2sgf INPUT_FILE > OUTPUT_FILE

<strong><a href="mlcm2sgf.py">mlcm2sgf.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
 Translates from mlcm format, as documented at
 http://www-lehre.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/theoinf/index/research/mlcm
 and described below to sgf format, also described below.

mlcm (multi-level crossing minimization) was used in the experiments
descibed in M. Chimani, P. Hungerlaender, M. Juenger, P. Mutzel. An SDP
Approach to Multi-level Crossing Minimization. ACM Journal of Experimental
Algorithmics, Volume 17(3), Article 3.3, 2012. It goes as follows:

Number-of-Levels
Number-of-Edges-Between-First-and-Second-Level
Number-of-Edges-Between-Second-and-Third-Level
...
Number-of-Nodes-on-First-Level
Number-of-Nodes-on-Second-Level
...
Index-of-Node-on-First-Layer Index-of-Node-on-Second-Level
Index-of-Node-on-First-Layer Index-of-Node-on-Second-Level
...
Index-of-Node-on-Second-Layer Index-of-Node-on-Third-Level
...

The node indices start at 0 on each level, i.e., each level has a node
numbered 0, a node numbered 1, etc. Numbers determine the order, which is
optimal in the files provided at the web site.

sfg format is as follows:

   c comment line 1
   ...
   c comment line k

   t graph_name num_nodes num_edges num_layers

   n id_1 layer_1 position_1
   n id_2 layer_2 position_2
   ...
   n id_n layer_n position_n

   e source_1 target_1
   ...
   e source_m target_m

<strong><a href="ralay.py">ralay.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
ralay.py - offers a mechanism for producing layered graphs with
  different variances with respect to number of nodes per layer, number of
  dummy nodes, degrees of nodes, shapes, etc.. Output is in sgf format, which
  can be converted to dot or graphml, as desired. Graphs are guaranteed to be
  connected (and interesting) because each node has indegree 1 (unless on layer 0)
  and outdegree 1 (unless on the highest layer).

<strong><a href="repeatHeuristics.sh">repeatHeuristics.sh</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
runs a sequence of heuristics, using minimization software, ../src/minimization,
a specified number of times, feeding optimum output of each run to the input of the next;
the sequence of heuristics and their options is read from a config file;
an optional argument gives a seed, allowing randomized versions of the heuristics;
an example of a config file is test_repeatHeuristics.txt;
</pre>

<li>
<strong><a href="runstats2csv.sh">runstats2csv.sh</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
reads a file in which each line contains a tag and a value and converts it
to a csv file where
  - there is a column for each distinct tag, with that tag as header
  - all values having that tag are in the column, in order of appearance
for example, if the file has a collection of lines of the form
     runtime VALUE
the output will have a column with header runtime and all instances of VALUE below it.

<strong><a href="scrambleSgf.py">scrambleSgf.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
Randomly permutes nodes and edges of an sgf file;
order in which nodes appear and their position in a layer are permuted independently

<strong><a href="sgf2layered_graphml.py">sgf2layered_graphml.py</a> --</strong><br>
<pre>
 translates from sgf format, described in the script, to the graphml format
 used by Galant. This program is a simple filter, translating from
 standard input to standard output.

<strong><a href="sgf2lff.py">sgf2lff.py</a> --</strong><br>

Translates from sgf format to lff format.
These formats are described in mlcm2sgf.py and lff2sgf.py, respectively.
