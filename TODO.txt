This repository is incomplete. The following items need to be copied from ~/MySoftware/Crossing-Minimization-private and cleaned up.

- python directory, selective; maybe put these all into scripts

- scripts directory (add .sh extensions where appropriate)

- testing directory (maybe expand number of tests)
